In this project, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine whether restaurant reviews are positive or negative. After the preliminary analysis is completed, the program learns to detect the sentiment of reviews. A confusion matrix is used to visualize its accuracy.

The data is from here: https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshwarsofficial/reviews
