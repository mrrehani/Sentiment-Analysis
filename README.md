## Description
In this project, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine whether restaurant reviews are positive or negative. After the preliminary analysis is completed, the program learns to detect the sentiment of reviews. A confusion matrix is used to visualize its accuracy.

### Technologies Used:
- Sklearn (Count Vectorizer, Logistic Regression)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK 

### Instructions
- Clone the repository
- Open the notebook file, making sure that the 'Restaurant_Reviews.csv' file is still in the same directory
- Run the all the cells

### Credits
The original source of the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vigneshwarsofficial/reviews).
I recieved help from this [guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-sentiment-analysis-in-python-95e354ea84f6).
